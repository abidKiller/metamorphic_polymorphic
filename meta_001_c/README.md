## meta_001_c


### Overview

 * Upon execution this program loads a copy of itself into memory as raw binary data
 * It then parses the ELF headers to find the .text section (where the executable code lies within the binary file data)
 * Next it scans through the .text section in memory looking for any instances of a random junk assembly sequence encoded as opcodes, and replaces these sequences with new randomly generated sequences
 * The updated binary data in memory is saved to disk (as a new file for demonstration purposes but ideally this would overwrite the original file)
 * The overall effect is that each time the program is run different sets of junk assembly instruction sequences are executed, making the code is metamorphic, but the changing opcodes don't relate to the main program function and so the code is always changing but the main program output/effect is consistent

For the sake of making this example clearer, rather than overwriting itself each time the program is run, the modified output is saved to a new file so that the original and new copy of the program can be disassembled/compared.


### Output

Below it can be seen that when executed for the first time, the program replaces the junk assembly sequences with new ones and saves this to a new file:

All existing junk sequences have been replaced

Wrote modified binary data to ./meta_002
```

When the output file is executed it again replaces the junk assembly sequences with new ones and it can be seen that the origin file and this new file are the same size but the SHA512 hashes are different:

```bash
$ ./meta_002

### Limitations

In reality it is easy to understand what this metamorphic program is doing when examining it with a debugger/disassembler. There is always the same number of junk assembly sequences spread throughout the file, and they are being replaced with different sequences of random opcodes they are always being replaced *in place*. Shifting the opcodes around will cause the function sizes to change (if the sequences are moved between functions) or even if the function size doesnâ€™t change (the sequences move location within the same function) calls/jumps/returns fail because the destination address becomes misaligned due to the change in function size or offset.

Also, when inserting the replacement junk assembly opcodes they aren't "any random opcodes", because this could cause the program to crash or unexpected behaviour to occur. Opcodes are chosen at random from within a certain range, which have been chosen to ensure they have no impact on the successful operation of the rest of the program code. The range is small because this is only an example. The choice and range of opcodes used could of course be expanded.
